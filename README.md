# PalindromeCheckerApp

This is a simple Java console application to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

In this project, I implemented different use cases to understand how palindrome checking works using different approaches and data structures.

Use Cases done:

UC1 – Welcome Page  
Displays the application name and starts the program.

UC2 – Hardcoded Palindrome  
Checks a predefined string to see if it is a palindrome.

UC3 – Reverse String Method  
Reverses the string using a loop and compares it with the original string.

UC4 – Character Array Method  
Converts the string into a character array and uses two pointers to compare characters from start and end.

UC5 – Stack Based Method  
Uses Stack data structure to push characters and pop them to check palindrome.

UC6 – Queue and Stack Based Method  
Uses both Queue (FIFO) and Stack (LIFO) to compare characters by enqueueing and pushing them, then matching dequeue and pop operations.

UC7- Deque Based Optimized Palindrome Checker
Each use case was created in a separate branch and merged into the main branch after testing.

Tools used:
Java  
IntelliJ  
Git and GitHub
